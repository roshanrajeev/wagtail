## Introduction

Hello everyone,

My name is Roshan and I'm a computer science engineering student from India with a passion for web development and quantum computing. I'm excited to join the Wagtail community and contribute to this incredible open-source project, as I have some experience with open-source contributions and am always eager to take on new challenges.

I have a strong foundation in Python and JavaScript and am also proficient in various web development technologies such as React, Django, Docker, and Jenkins, which I have utilized in multiple projects.

When I created my first blog, I searched for the best CMS integration with Gatsby. I tried various solutions such as Strapi, Contentful, and NetlifyCMS, and came to appreciate the importance of a CMS that provides a great user experience. I'm impressed by Wagtail's work as a CMS and its potential to revolutionize content management for businesses and organizations. I'm excited to learn more about Wagtail, and I look forward to its Gatsby integration. ðŸ˜„

I'm eager to collaborate with the Wagtail community, and you can find me on Github at https://github.com/roshanrajeev and on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/roshanrjv.
